<p>IvozProvider is a multilevel role provider solution.</p>
<p>The following images shows the different available levels and the relation between them:</p>
<img alt="../_images/operator_levels1.png" src="../_images/operator_levels1.png" />
<p>This section will explain each of the available roles, describing their responsibilities and more important tasks.</p>
<div class="section" id="rol-de-administrador-global">
<h2>Global administator role</h2>
<p>The global administator role (operator in the image) is usually done by the installation responsible.</p>
<p>All options and platform features are visible to this role and usually is in charge of its maintenance.</p>
<p>Their most important task is to <strong>create Brands</strong> and configure them so they have the enough autonomy to properly use the platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p class="first">Configure their web access.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Configure their brand portal look and feel: themes, colors, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Appart from their main task, their global visibility and total access makes them responsible of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Monitor the platform so it keeps always UP &amp; RUNNING</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Analyze platform logs to track possible errors.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Polish the security mechanisms to avoid external attacks.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Obtain global statistics of calls audio quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Increase the available resources of the platform as long as is needed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p class="first">Increasing resources available in a standalone installation</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Migrating, whenever required, to a distributed installation with multiple AS, media relays, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, <strong>this role is the only one that has no limits within the platform</strong>, thats why <em>God</em> is a term used in multiple places along this documentation.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last"><em>This role is responsible of maintain the platform*</em>, configuring it for the correct behaviour. This role <strong>doesn&#8217;t have any kind of limit</strong> and <strong>grants access</strong> to the <strong>brand operators</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rol-de-operador-de-marca">
<h2>Brand andministator role</h2>
<p>Brand operator can access a portal with less sections available compared to the previous role. The general (God) administrator is in charge of providing an URL with credentials for its brand portal.</p>
<p>The most important task for brand operator can be managed through this portal: <strong>create and configure companies so they can work properly</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to brand operators are also resposible of billing their companies and make sure the external cals are properly setup, it must also manage:</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">Create the invoices for each billing period and send them to their clients.</p>
